If we want to hook some custom mechanisms when we access obj.foo, property
decorator should be used.
property is a special kind of descriptor only, in which __get__ and __set__
methods are defined in the class itself.

Rules of thumb:

1. If we are using lot of If/Else cases in __getattr__, probably we should
implement it using properties. 
2. Nearly 80% of the use cases are fullfilled through properties.
3. If their are lot of properties in the code, try to do it using descriptors.
